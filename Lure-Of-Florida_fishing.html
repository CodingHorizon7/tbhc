  <section class="summary container">
    <h2>The Lure of Florida Fishing</h2>
    <p>
      Cast a line through more than a century of Florida’s angling history. “The Lure of Florida Fishing” explores how Florida evolved from coastal fishing traditions to becoming a world‑class angling destination. The exhibit runs August 23, 2025 through January 11, 2026. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Inside, visitors encounter over 50 locally made lures, vintage rods and reels, historic photographs, and rare artifacts — each telling a story of anglers, charter captains, and fishermen who shaped the state’s maritime identity. Also featured are fishing maps from the Touchton Map Library, including many once‑guarded “secret spots,” offering a glimpse into fishing practices dating back decades. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The exhibit presents a rich mix of history, art, and storytelling: 22 original fish paintings by Southern artist William Aiken Walker — recovered after years in storage — sit alongside sculptures, carved fish, and memorabilia, celebrating the natural beauty and cultural impact of Florida’s fishing tradition.  
    </p>
    <p>
      “The Lure of Florida Fishing” also highlights how fishing shaped communities, tourism, and environmental awareness, recognizing notable anglers of the past and the conservation efforts that protect Florida’s waters today.
