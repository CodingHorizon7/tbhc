  <section class="summary container">
    <h2>Mapping the American Sea</h2>
    <p>
      “Mapping the American Sea” reframes U.S. history by putting the Gulf of Mexico — and Florida — at the center of colonial, maritime, and geopolitical narratives. The exhibit features dozens of historic maps and charts, including a rare 1524 map commissioned by Hernán Cortés. This map is known to be one of the first printed maps to name “Florida,” and remains a cornerstone of the collection.  
    </p>
    <p>
      Visitors follow an arc from early European exploration maps through centuries of maritime trade, colonial expansion, and shifting borders — seeing how control of the Gulf shaped development, commerce, and cultural exchange. The gallery draws from the holdings of the Touchton Map Library & Florida Center for Cartographic Education, presenting maps and nautical documents that span more than 500 years of Gulf‑region history.  
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to colonial‑era charts, the exhibit includes modern navigational maps that illustrate Gulf maritime activities — including wartime naval routes during 20th‑century conflicts. The juxtaposition of old and new maps invites visitors to reflect on how geography, access to waterways, and maritime routes have influenced Florida’s—and America’s—history and identity.
